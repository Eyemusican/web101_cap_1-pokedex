### Pokemon Web App

The Pokemon Web App is a fun and interactive website that allows users to explore and discover information about various Pokemon species. It uses PokeAPI to fetch Pokemon data and provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for browsing and capturing Pokemon.

### Features

#### Pokemon List: 
1. You can see a list of Pokemon cards showing their name, weight, height, and picture.
2.  The Pokemon cards are displayed in a grid layout, making it easy to browse through them.

#### Pokemon Details:
1. Each Pokemon card flips over to reveal more information about the Pokemon, like its species, abilities and types.
2. When you hover over a Pokemon card, it flips to show the back side.
3. The back side of the card displays the Pokemon's species (e.g., "Seed Pokemon"), a list of its abilities (e.g., "Overgrow, Chlorophyll"), and a list of its types (e.g., "Grass, Poison").
               
#### Search:
1. You can search for a specific Pokemon by typing its name or ID number.
2. As you type, the website will try to find the Pokemon you're looking for and display its card.

#### Generation Filter: 
1. The website has a dropdown menu to show Pokemon from different generations.
2. Selecting a generation from the list will filter the Pokemon cards to only show Pokemon from that generation.
